Hi, I am Shinto C V.

I have been working as a software engineer since 2015. I wanted to start writing about things that I am working with or 
thinking about. It is said writing brings clarity. So why not start a blog? Well, here it is!

Workwise mostly I am involved with DevOps and Cloud. 

I like to write code as well. Mostly for fun!

I want to use this blog to share my adventures into the crazy and exciting world of tech.

If you find anything interesting here and want to reach out please use any of my social media profiles provided below.
